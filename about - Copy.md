Like your organization, this website is getting better everyday! Come back after a few days to see a better version! Or stay and watch this highly underwhelming process unfold :))

About Me
I am Bhavesh, a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UMass Amherst set to graduate in December 2019. This webpage is my effort towards giving my qualifications a visual dimension.

I have been associated with Mechanical Engineering for the past 11 years, 8 years academically and 3 years professionally. And I have loved every minute of it. My initial aim, which I have still sustained, is to build technologies which make a tangible difference in this world and leave an impact to be proud of. I try to not be constrained by the Mechanical Engineering discipline and try to find ways to implement advanced math in different fields and essentially trying to stay application-agnostic.

Although my major is Mechanical Engineering, I am enthusiastic about learning something new everyday and finding ways implementing it in form of projects. Currently I am doing that by going through the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program. As a part of this program I am learning path planning, navigation and neural networks. Being very new to most of these concepts, this course is a challenge that I absolutely relish. Keep checking on the Autonomous Vehicles project section to track my progress.


**Beliefs:**
I strongly advocate rapid environmental action to mitigate climate change. As an extension of that, I believe in empowerment of rural economies by producing technologies for their self-sustenance. 

**Interests:**
I am an avid biker (both with and without engines) and I hope to compete in an extreme mountain-biking event some day.

**Aspiration:**
Utilize my knowledge towards solving a problem that has a net positive impact on the environment.

**Fun fact:**
I am a huge fan of my pressure cooker. Even use it to cook a one-pot-pasta in 5 minutes. (Saves a lot of time, water and cooking gas).
