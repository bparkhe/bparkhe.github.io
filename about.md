## About Me

I am Bhavesh, a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UMass Amherst set to graduate in December 2019. This webpage is my effort towards giving my qualifications a visual dimension.

I have been associated with Mechanical Engineering for the past 11 years, 8 years academically and 3 years professionally. And I have loved every minute of it. My initial aim, which still remains is to build technologies which make a tangible difference in this world and leave an impact to be proud of. That is waht motivated me to initially pursue Mechanical Engineering.

Although my major is Mechanical Engineering, I am enthusiastic about learning something new everyday and finding ways implementing it in form of projects. Currently I am doing that by going through the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program. As a part of this program I am learning path planning, navigation and neural networks. Being relatively new to most of these concepts, this course probelm solving skills at their best!!

I hope my projects on this page give you a glimpse of how I improve.

  I have underwent diverse coursework but with a common aim, to build efficient technologies. The mathematically rigorous coursework has ensured that I can apply my training to a diverse rage of projects. During my time at UMass Amherst I have focussed on identification and modelling of controllers.

  As I head closer to my Graduation (December 2019), I am actively looking for opportunities to apply my skills. My ideal job would involve tasks with rigorous mathematical analysis.
