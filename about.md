## About Me

This webpage is my effort towards giving a visual dimension to my resume.

I have been associated with Mechanical Engineering for the past 11 years, 8 years academically and 3 years professionally. And I have loved every minute of it.  I have always had a strong urge to build technologies which make a tangible difference in our lives. It is due to this aspiration that I pursued a Technical Diploma (Associates Degree) in Mechanical Engineering right after 10th grade and have progressively had grown fascinated to keep learning more and more. I am not constrained by the Mechanical Engineering discipline and always find ways to implement projects from different fields while trying to be application-agnostic.

**Beliefs:**
I strongly advocate rapid environmental action to mitigate climate change. As an extension of that, I believe in empowerment of rural economies by producing technologies for their self-sustenance. 

**Interests:**
I am an avid biker (both with and without engines) and I hope to compete in an extreme mountain-biking event some day.

**Aspiration:**
Utilize my knowledge towards solving a problem that has a net positive impact on the environment.

**Fun fact:**
I am a huge fan of my pressure cooker. Even use it to cook a one-pot-pasta in 5 minutes. (Saves a lot of time, water, cooking gas and is in line with my sustainable-living goals).

**Current Status:**
I am continuing my foray into Industrial Automation by learning about PLC / HMI & SCADA and I am learning about the different communication protocols like Modbus which commonly used for security applications in this field. Since I cannot afford to have a PLC or supporting equipment, I am pushing through with an Arduino and SoftPLC. Keep checking my webpage for a future post regarding projects I implement using these.
