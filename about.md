## About Me

I am Bhavesh, a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UMass Amherst set to graduate in December 2019. This webpage is my effort towards giving my resume a visual dimension and portray my achievements effectively. 

During my time a t UMass Amherst I have focussed on indetification and modelling of controllers fro different applications.
My ideal job would involve mathematical analysis due to my 8+ years of academic focus and 3 years of professional association with this field.
