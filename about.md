## About Me

I am Bhavesh, a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UMass Amherst set to graduate in December 2019. This webpage is my effort towards giving my qaulifications a visual dimension and portray my achievements more effectively. 

I have been associated with Mechanical Engineering for the past 11 years, 8 years academically and 3 years professionally. And I have loved every minute of it. My initial aim, which still remains is to build technologies which make a tangible difference in this world and leave an impact to be proud of. That gets me out of bed every morning. I believe that any organization I am associated with will  have my utmost motivation towards its big picture. 

# My UMass Journey
 

I have underwent diverse coursework but with a common aim, to build efficient technologies. The mathematically rigorous coursework has ensured that I can apply my training to a diverse rage of projects. 
During my time at UMass Amherst I have focussed on identification and modelling of controllers.

# My Present Goal
As I head closer to my Graduation (December 2019), I am actively looking for opportunities to apply my skills. My ideal job would involve tasks with rigorous mathematical analysis.
