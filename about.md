## About Me

This webpage is my effort towards giving a visual dimension to my resume.

I have been associated with Mechanical Engineering for the past 11 years, 8 years academically and 3 years professionally. And I have loved every minute of it. 

I have always had a strong urge to build technologies which make a tangible difference in our lives. It is due to this aspiration that I pursued a Technical Diploma (Associates Degree) in Mechanical Engineering right after 10th grade and have progressively grown fascinated by learning mroe and more. I am not constrained by the Mechanical Engineering discipline and always find ways to implement projects from different fields. I am fascinated and love working with advanced math and would be glad to stay application-agnostic.


**Beliefs:**
I strongly advocate rapid environmental action to mitigate climate change. As an extension of that, I believe in empowerment of rural economies by producing technologies for their self-sustenance. 

**Interests:**
I am an avid biker (both with and without engines) and I hope to compete in an extreme mountain-biking event some day.

**Aspiration:**
Utilize my knowledge towards solving a problem that has a net positive impact on the environment.

**Fun fact:**
I am a huge fan of my pressure cooker. Even use it to cook a one-pot-pasta in 5 minutes. (Saves a lot of time, water and cooking gas).
