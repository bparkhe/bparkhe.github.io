## About Me

I am Bhavesh, a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UMass Amherst set to graduate in December 2019. This webpage is my effort towards giving my qualifications a visual dimension.

I have been associated with Mechanical Engineering for the past 11 years, 8 years academically and 3 years professionally. And I have loved every minute of it. My initial aim, which I have still sustained, is to build technologies which make a tangible difference in this world and leave an impact to be proud of. I try to not be constrained by the Mechanical Engineering discipline and try to find ways to implement advaced math in different fields and essentially trying to stay application-agnostic.

Although my major is Mechanical Engineering, I am enthusiastic about learning something new everyday and finding ways implementing it in form of projects. Currently I am doing that by going through the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program. As a part of this program I am learning path planning, navigation and neural networks. Being very new to most of these concepts, this course is a challenge that I absolutely relish. Keep checking on the Autonomous Vehicles project section to track my progress.
