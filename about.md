## About Me

I am Bhavesh, a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UMass Amherst set to graduate in December 2019. This webpage is my effort towards giving my resume a visual dimension and portray my achievements effectively. 

During my time at UMass Amherst I have focussed on identification and modelling of controllers for different applications like roll-2-roll printing. My ideal job would involve mathematical analysis due to my 8+ years of academic focus and 3 years of professional association with this field.
